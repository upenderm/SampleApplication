Java 7:
===========

1) Try-with-resources construct
try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("file1.txt")){}
2) Catching multiple exceptions in same catch block
try {}catch(SQLException e || IOException ex){}
3) Usage of diamond operator in Generics
List<String> cityList = new ArrayList<>();
4) Using Strings in switch statements - Takes string type as an argument
switch(status) {
            caseNEW:
newTrade(t);
break;
}
5) Fork join 
Basically the Fork-Join breaks the task at hand into mini-tasks until the mini-task is simple enough that it can be solved without further breakups. The core classes supporting the Fork-Join mechanism are ForkJoinPool and ForkJoinTask.
6) Underscores in numeric literals
int one_million = 10_00_000;
7) varargs
